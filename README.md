# Deltagram

A powerful command-line tool for applying structured file changes using the deltagram format - an advanced evolution of the mimeogram format that supports delta operations for efficient file manipulation.

## Overview

Deltagram enables you to apply complex file changes including:
- **Creating** new files with content
- **Modifying** existing files using unified diff format  
- **Copying** files to new locations
- **Moving/renaming** files
- **Deleting** files

All operations are bundled into a single deltagram that can be read from the clipboard and applied atomically to your project.

## Features

- üîÑ **Delta Operations**: CREATE, MODIFY, COPY, MOVE, DELETE
- üìã **Clipboard Integration**: Read deltagrams directly from clipboard
- üéØ **Unified Diff Support**: Industry-standard patch format for content changes
- üîí **Atomic Operations**: All changes applied in correct order or none at all
- üß™ **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration test coverage
- üåç **Cross-platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows support
- ‚ö° **Fast & Reliable**: Written in Go for performance

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Clipboard utilities:
  - **Linux**: `xclip` or `xsel`
  - **macOS**: Built-in `pbpaste`
  - **Windows**: Built-in PowerShell clipboard

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/developingjames/deltagrams.git
cd deltagrams

# Build for your platform
make build

# Install to $GOPATH/bin
make install

# Build for all platforms
make build-all
```

### Binary Downloads

Download pre-built binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/developingjames/deltagrams/releases).

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Apply deltagram from clipboard to current directory
deltagram apply

# Show version information
deltagram version

# Show help
deltagram help
```

### Example Workflow

1. Copy a deltagram to your clipboard (from an LLM, text editor, etc.)
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Run `deltagram apply`
4. All file operations are applied atomically

## Deltagram Format

Deltagrams use a structured format based on mimeograms with added delta operation support. See [deltagram_prompt.md](deltagram_prompt.md) for the complete specification.

### Using with LLMs

To enable deltagram generation in AI assistants:

1. Copy the contents of [deltagram_prompt.md](deltagram_prompt.md)
2. Paste it into your LLM conversation or system prompt
3. Ask the AI to generate deltagrams for your file changes
4. Copy the generated deltagram and use `deltagram apply`

This teaches the AI assistant the proper deltagram format and validation requirements.

### Adding New Operations

1. Create a new handler in `pkg/operations/`
2. Implement the `OperationHandler` interface
3. Register it in `pkg/operations/applier.go`
4. Add comprehensive tests

### Dependencies

This project uses only Go standard library and has no external dependencies for the core functionality.

## Architecture

### Components

- **Parser**: Parses deltagram format into structured data
- **Operations**: Handles different types of file operations
- **Clipboard**: Cross-platform clipboard reading
- **CLI**: Command-line interface and version management

### Design Principles

- **Dependency Injection**: All components use interfaces for testability
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between parsing, operations, and I/O
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with context
- **Cross-platform**: Native support for major operating systems
